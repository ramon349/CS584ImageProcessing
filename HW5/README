Move the file darknet.py to the corresponding darknet folder to run ifnerence properly. Script usses absolute paths to find images. 

if replicating  results change: 
  model used, model_cfg,model_weights and meta using absolute paths 
  
 voc_label.py should be run from the repos directory. it was modified so that the final labels would be the class names instead of the IDs. Also fixed some strange pathing 
 issue
